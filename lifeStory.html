			<h1> Life Story </h1>
			<p> My name is Kaleab Alebachew and I was born in 1990 Addis Abeba. From my father Alebachew Mola and my mother Tigest Getachew.</p>
			<p>	Our research problem is how to make application programming more worthwhile. Our initial
				explorations focused on making it easier â€” ie, making it more worthwhile by allowing less experienced
				people to create programs more quickly [see Klinker 90 and McDermott 90]. A
				number of researchers have focused on the issue of how to make application programming easier
				[see Krueger 89]. The efforts most closely related to our own include [Bennett 85, Birmingham
				88, Breuker 89, Chandra 83, Clancey 83, Davis 79, Eshelman 88, Klinker 88, Marcus 88,
				Musen 91 and Yost 89]. Each of these research efforts has identified one or more problemsolving
				methods and shown </p>
			<p>This paper describes a framework for identifying homes for effective application programs and
				for making the construction of those programs easier. A high level overview of our framework
				is presented in section 2. Sections 3 through 7 provide more details. The framework includes a
				place for workplace analysis (section 3), using the results of the analysis to model the
				workplace (section 4), generating a workflow management application program (section 5), se-
				\ lecting and configuring reusable mechanisms that can assist with some of the work (section 6),
				customizing the mechanisms for the workplace thus generating one or more application proi
				grams (section 7).</p>
