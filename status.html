			<h1> Status </h1>
			<p>At this very moment I am enrolled in Adama Science and Technology University in a 5yr bachelor degree program</p>
			<p>	<h2>Reading books</h2><br>
				 I am into scientific inovations and the logic and workings behind it.<br>

			<p>This paper describes a framework for identifying homes for effective application programs and
				for making the construction of those programs easier. A high level overview of our framework
				is presented in section 2. Sections 3 through 7 provide more details. The framework includes a
				place for workplace analysis (section 3), using the results of the analysis to model the
				workplace (section 4), generating a workflow management application program (section 5), se-
				\ lecting and configuring reusable mechanisms that can assist with some of the work (section 6),
				customizing the mechanisms for the workplace thus generating one or more application proi
				grams (section 7).</p>
